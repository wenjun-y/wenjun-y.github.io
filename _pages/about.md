I am currently a teacher-scholar and postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Jianping Pan](https://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~pan/) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria, where I also received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Lin Cai](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~cai/) in 2024.



My Research [\[Publications\]](/publications/)
======
My past research work aimed at addressing critical challenges in the future Internet ecosystem dominated by mobile entities including users, vehicles, satellites, and UAVs. My work centers on fulfilling stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements for diverse communication applications through powerful AI tools, innovative network architecture design, multipath transport protocols, mobility management, satellite networks, multimedia systems, etc. See the project website at [here](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/quic/).

My current research focus is distributed machine learning systems, aiming to build efficient systems of training and inference of deep neural networks.
